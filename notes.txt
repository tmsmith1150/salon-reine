npx create-react-app photo-port

npm install
npm start

******do this after npm init & install ( modules instruct to do this(below) before npm install and npm start but doing so causes conflict) *****
create-react-app automatically uses the latest release of React. Due to several conflicting packages with the newer React version 18, follow the steps below to ensure that all packages in this module project will work as intended with React version 17:

Delete the package-lock.json file and node_modules folder from the client directory.

Downgrade react to 17.0.2 inside of the package.json file.

Downgrade react-dom to 17.0.2 inside of the package.json file.

Downgrade @testing-library/react to ^11.1.0 inside of the package.json file.


Setting up the repo
convert to git repo rather than cloning
**git init
**create your repo
**git remote add origin <url>

****APP NOT RENDERING & Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-dom/client'*** 
after completing the module my app would no longer render, error: could not find react-dom/client
had to delete node_modules and package-lock.json and npm install
had to change react version back to 18 in package.json and add Strickmode to main index.js
Also, changed <React.StrictMode> in main index.js to <StrictMode>
Note*** main index.js is different in snap shot code
